The goal of noaaquake is to clean and visualize raw NOAA earthquake data

## Installation

You can install the released version of noaaquake from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("noaaquake")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("adeel1997/noaaquake")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how one can visualize the data from the package

```
library(noaaquake)
data_clean <- NOAA_data %>%
 eq_clean_data() %>%
 dplyr::filter(Country == "India"|Country == "Pakistan" & lubridate::year(date) >= 2000)
 eq_map(data = data_clean, annot_col = "Mag")

```
